### **Project Title**
ShadowX-Lunar Image Enhancement: A Tool for Improving Low-Light Images

### **Project Description**
This project provides an interactive tool to enhance low-light images using Python and OpenCV. Designed for lunar applications, it enables users to upload or capture images and apply histogram equalization for improved visibility. The tool is particularly useful for processing images from PSR regions of lunar craters.

### **Features**
- Upload or capture images directly in the application.
- Enhance images with histogram equalization.
- Interactive interface using IPython widgets.
- Visualize both original and enhanced images.

### **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - OpenCV
  - Matplotlib
  - NumPy
  - IPython widgets
- **Environment**: Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook

### **Setup Instructions**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Avishkar1
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib ipywidgets
   ```
4. Run the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab.

### **Usage**
1. Choose between uploading an image or capturing a new one.
2. View the original image.
3. Enhance the image by clicking the **Enhance Image** button.
4. Save or analyze the enhanced image.
